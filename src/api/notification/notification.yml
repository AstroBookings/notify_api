Feature: Send launch-related notifications to agencies
  As an agency, I want to receive notifications about launch-related events, so that I can stay informed about the status of my launches.

  Scenario: Send a notification about a launch status change
    Given the API is available
    When the system sends a POST request to "/api/notification/" with the following data:
      | event |  data |
      | "newBooking" |  { launch_id: 1, booking_id: 1 } |
    Then the response should have a status code of 200
    And the notification data to be sent to the agency
        | recipient_email | subject | message |
        | "agency@example.com" | "New booking for launch" | "You have a new booking for launch 1" |
